Serial Communication for Data Packets

This program was written using the public RXTX API.  For my senior design project I used this program to allow a laptop to listen for data coming from a USB port.  The devices we created used a USB port in order communicate using serial communication (UART).  This is not an Android application, but demonstrates my experience programming in Java.
