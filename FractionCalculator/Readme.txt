Fraction Calculator Application

Author Bobby Bounvichit

For one of my Java projects in school we made a fraction calculator, but without a user interface.  After I learned how to program applications for Android I made this project outside of my school work.  The project was intended to allow users to input fractions and calculate various operations using the fractions.
