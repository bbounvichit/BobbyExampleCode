Innolance Blog Application

While I was learning how to program applications for Android I created this application as practice and to demonstrate to my boss.  The application uses the URL's of various blogs written by author's within the company and displays them in a List and Webview.  Fragments were used so that the UI is different for a mobile Android phone versus an Android Tablet.  

*Only the layout .xml files and the source java files are included in this file.
